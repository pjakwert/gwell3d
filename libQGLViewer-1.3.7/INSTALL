To compile the library, simply do :
 > cd QGLViewer
 > qmake
 > make
 > make install

And then compile the examples :
 > cd ../examples
 > qmake
 > make

See doc/download.html and doc/rpm.html for installation details
(including Win32 installation).

You can configure the installation directories
(default are /usr/local/include/QGLViewer and /usr/local/lib).

If you didn't "make install" the library, use
  > qmake INCLUDE_DIR=../.. LIB_DIR=../../QGLViewer
  > make
to compile the examples.

See doc/examples/index.html for a description of the examples.
