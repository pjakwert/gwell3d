libQGLViewer  is  an  open source C++ library which enables you to quickly start the
development  of a new 3D application. It is designed for 3D developers, who can very
easily display and move around a 3D scene by simply providing the OpenGL orders that
define their 3D geometry. The viewer is designed to be as general as possible and is
not  designed for a specific 3D application. It provides some useful classical func-
tionalities such as a camera trackball, screenshot saving, mouse manipulated frames,
stereo display, keyFrames and more.

libQGLViewer  is not a 3D viewer that can be used directly to view some 3D scenes in
various  formats  (there is a 3dsViewer example, but it is just a proof of concept).
It is actually more likely to be the starting point for the coding of such a viewer.

The viewer's main functionalities are : 

     - A camera trackball to easily move the camera is the scene (explorer
       or walkthrough mode). Definition and replay of KeyFrame paths.
     - Screenshot saving in different file formats (JPG, PNG, EPS...). 
     - Handling  of local (possibly hierarchical) coordinate systems, that
       can be moved with the mouse. 
     - Extendable  displacement  constraints  that  can  be applied on the
       displacement of those frames. 
     - FPS and axis display, fast drawing of the scene and many convenient
       functions.
     - An intuitive default behaviour that can be entirely redefined. 
     - Stereo display (provided that your machine supports it). 
     - Many simple examples illustrating the different functionalities and
       a complete reference documentation.
