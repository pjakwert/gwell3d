<h1><b>Gwell</b></h1> 

Gwell is an open-source (GNU-GPL license) interactive 3D modelling application based on <a href="https://opengl.org">OpenGL</a> for UNIX/Linux platforms, using XWindow and <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt framework</a>.

Its purpose is to provide fully integrated graphical environment for creating and simulating robots, and their
working area. Application uses open kinematic chain architecture representing objects' hierarchy. Complex models
consist of elementary 3D primitives grouped in custom, expandable libraries.

Gwell offers objects and material creation/manipulation, texture mapping, blending, lighting, shadows and fog effects. 
Defining control interfaces allows user to simulate models in real-time, and Gwell is performance optimized for this task. 

Application's interface is flexible and fully customizable, with multiple translations included (adding new ones is possible).
